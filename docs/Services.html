            <div class="service-content">
                <p>This dedicated community work has inspired a critical research initiative that explores the <strong>Ife divination system</strong>, an ancient Niger Delta practice based on zeros and ones that fundamentally <strong>predates George Boole's formalization of Boolean algebra</strong>. Through rigorous mathematical conversion, I'm translating this complex, cultural system into modern Boolean algebra and finite field frameworks.</p>
                <p>By analyzing the Ife system's underlying patterns, I am discovering new structures and efficiency principles with tangible applications in modern computational science. This project is a powerful synthesis of cultural preservation, abstract mathematics, and cutting-edge technology.</p>

                    <h4>Dual Impact</h4>
                    <p><strong>First:</strong> Contributing to ethno-mathematics by preserving and demonstrating how African intellectual traditions engaged with concepts foundational to computer science centuries ago.</p>
                    <p><strong>Second:</strong> Opening new avenues in coding theory and demonstrating relevance to binary neural networks in machine learning.</p>
